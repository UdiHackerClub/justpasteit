# justpasteit
Simple python script to: create and validate a justpaste.it link

Justpaste.it works with a simple url
  justpaste.it/12345
  
Knowing that, i made a simple python script to create 5 random numbers, and after, send a GET request to the generated link

If it returns 200, saves to a 200.txt, 404 saves to a 404.txt and so on.

The goal here is to dig into this site and find out cool things (or not so cool)

Besides that, theres one print.py script that uses Selenium to take screenshots.

This is to check the content of the site without opening it one by one (lazy, ik)
